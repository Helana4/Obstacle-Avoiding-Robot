# Obstacle-Avoiding Robot

This project is part of the **Microcontroller Systems** course at the **Faculty of Computers and Information, Ain Shams University**.

We designed and built a simple robot using an Arduino UNO that detects obstacles and avoids them automatically using an ultrasonic sensor.

## 👥 Team Members
- Helana Asaad
- Yostina Nabil
- Angie Mamadoh
- Myriam Ayman
- Cathrine Yousry

## 🔧 Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- L298N Motor Driver
- Two DC motors
- 9V battery
- Breadboard and wires

## ⚙️ How It Works
- The robot moves forward.
- If an obstacle is detected within 40 cm:
  - It reverses
  - Turns right
  - Then continues moving forward

## 💻 Code
The code is written in Arduino C++ using the Arduino IDE.  
You can find the main logic in the file `robot.ino`.



## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
- Sensor integration (ultrasonic)
- Basic motor control
- Real-time obstacle handling
- Team collaboration on hardware and software
